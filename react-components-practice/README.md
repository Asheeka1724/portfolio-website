# React Components Practice

This project demonstrates the creation of reusable React components and dynamic UI rendering using **props** and **state**.

## 📌 Objective

To build and understand reusable UI components in React and implement dynamic behavior using:

* Functional Components
* Props for data passing
* useState Hook for state management
* Event handling
* Component composition

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* React JS (Create React App)
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* HTML5
* CSS3 (Inline Styling)

---

## 📂 Project Structure

└── index.js
```

## 🔹 Components Implemented

### 1. Header Component

* Displays the application title.
* Receives data dynamically using props.

### 2. Footer Component

* Displays footer information.
* Reusable layout component.

### 3. Card Component

* Displays project information.
* Dynamically rendered using props and `.map()`.

### 4. Button Component

* Reusable button element.
* Accepts label and click handler as props.

### 5. Form Component

* Demonstrates state management using `useState`.
* Controlled input field.
* Handles user interaction and events.
